<h4>30 years of experience in newspapers and online media, print and web content production, sub-editing, news editing, writing and reporting, social media, SEO, training and managing.</h4>
<hr>
<p>In my 30 years with MEN Media in its different forms, I have performed every possible role within the editorial arm - reporter, photographer, news editor, sub-editor, page layout, and editor of print editions, and helping to edit the Manchester Evening News website, the UK's biggest regional site and Website of the Year at the 2019 Regional Press Awards.
    I also helped to run the title's hugely successful social media platforms - the MEN was named Social Media Team of the Year at the 2017 Regional Press Awards following our work on the Manchester Arena bomb attack.
    I am currently Deputy Football Editor at the MEN, helping to run our unrivalled coverage of Manchester United and Manchester City and reaching an increasing number of fans both in the city and across the world.
    I have also managed and mentored teams in news, sport and video departments, and carried out training of new systems across the whole editorial staff.</p>

<h3>Work history</h3>
<ul>
    <li> Reporter, sub-editor, news editor, deputy editor, editor - MEN Media (1993-2001)</li>
    <p>I spent the first seven years of my career as a reporter at the Heywood Advertiser.
        From here I spent 18 months as deputy news editor and sub-editor at the Accrington Observer. I also had secondment stints deputy editing and editing a number of the company's weekly titles including the Tameside Advertiser, Salford Advertiser and Oldham Advertiser.
        I then moved to become a full-time sub at the Rochdale Observer, and it was during this period that I also took on the role as website editor for the paper, which developed into the full-time web editor role which saw me launch and develop the websites of our 17 weekly titles.</p>
    <li>Online Editor, Newsdesk Editor, Content Producer - MEN Media (2001-2020) </li>
    <p>When the various weekly titles I worked for merged with the Manchester Evening News, I then added editing the MEN website to my role, with responsibilities for updating, maintaining and developing the site, which attracts more than 80m page views a month and is the biggest regional newspaper site in the country.
        My job has now developed to encompass not just producing and editing content for the website (stories, live blogs, audio/video), but also running our numerous social media accounts, and being part of the main MEN newsdesk team running the daily news operation. Currently I'm the head of publishing standards, with a remit of ensuring the highest quality production levels on our content. My role also involves management and mentoring of teams of editorial staff, and training staff across departments in new systems as they are introduced.</p>
    <li>Deputy Football Editor - Manchester Evening News (2020-2024)</li>
    <p>I helped to run the MEN's unrivalled coverage of Manchester United and Manchester City football clubs, attracting an increasing number of fans in the city and across the world, through our reports, analysis, opinion and live blogs, and through our social channels that reach millions of people worldwide.</p>
